# Who da heck is dis guy

Yo, shizzle ma whizzle, I'm just another FE dude who happens
to blog about some crap on the internet.

# But what do you do????? Srsly!!!11

Ok, so I'm - obviously - a front-end developer.
I'm currently a core developer at DHIS2, working remotely.

I'm very curious about software architecture in combination with 
functional programming and about better ways of code style
even if it upset's conservative programmers.

# Anything else we should know about you?

Nope. Dunno. More might follow ;)
